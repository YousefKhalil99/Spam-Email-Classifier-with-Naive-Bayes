# Spam-Email-Classifier-with-Naive-Bayes

We are given four datasets of labelled SMS and two lists of words:  
• training.cvs, validation.cvs, test1.cvs and test2.cvs
• list censored test1.txt, list censored test2.txt

Using these datasets, we will build a Naive Bayes spam email classifier and construct a confusion matrix to evaluate its performance
